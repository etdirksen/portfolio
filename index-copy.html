                <br><br>
                Takes a series of comma separated value files, imports them into a PostgreSQL table which was created from a schema through QuickDBD, and runs filters, joins, and other manipulations on several tables to perform an analysis. The goal is to find statistics on how many employees are retiring from a given dataset. This showcases my skills and experience with a SQL database, as well as creating a diagram which maps out the relationships between the tables and columns. This diagram became the schema for the tables which was later imported to PgAdmin.
