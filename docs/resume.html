                    <br><br>
                    This project shows my experience with API calls using JavaScript, HTML5 & CSS. The program grabs GeoJSON data of earthquakes over the past 7 days on a global scale. Then, it overlays a scatter-plot of earthquake occurrences and their severity according to their geographical coordinates and other information gathered from the data.

                    <br><br>
                    Analyzes an imaginary car company’s safety metrics and compares them to existing car manufacturer’s safety metrics. This demonstrates my ability with R and my experience with performing a statistical analysis with given data.

                    <b><a href="https://github.com/etdirksen/Retiring-Employee-Analysis">PostgreSQL Analysis: Retiring Employees</a> | August 2022 | Author</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Takes a series of comma separated value files, imports them into a PostgreSQL table which was created from a schema through QuickDBD, and runs filters, joins, and other manipulations on several tables to perform an analysis. The goal is to find statistics on how many employees are retiring from a given dataset. This showcases my skills and experience with a SQL database, as well as creating a diagram which maps out the relationships between the tables and columns. This diagram became the schema for the tables which was later imported to PgAdmin.
